# NumberTheory

Elementary Number Theory programs (that helps me on assignments). 

---

### Makefile

To create the binary for a program, run `make *` where * is the name of the program.

### Cayley Table:

This program will ask you to input 2 sets of numbers and will return the corresponding Cayley Table.

### Multiplicative Inverses:

This program will ask you to input n for integers modulo n and return all multiplicative inverses of n.

$\mathbb{z} / n\mathbb{z} \ \forall n \in \mathbb{z}$

### Subgroup Check

This program will ask you to input a set of numbers (A) as the group along with its operation and another set of numbers (B) as the potential subgroup. The program will return whether the B is a subgroup of A. 

### Quotient Group

This program will ask you input a set of numbers (A) as a group along with its operation and another set of numbers (B) as a subgroup representative. The program will return whether A/B is a valid quotient group.
