# NumberTheory

Elementary Number Theory programs (that helps me on assignments). 

### Makefile

To create the binary for a program, run `make *` where * is the name of the program (i.e. `make MultiplicativeInverses`)

### Multiplicative Inverses:

This program will ask you to input n for integers modulo n and return all multiplicative inverses of n.

$\mathbb{z} / n\mathbb{z} \ \forall n \in \mathbb{z}$
